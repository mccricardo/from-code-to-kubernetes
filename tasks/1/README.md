# Build and Run the service
Inside the `app` folder you can find a very basic service, written in [Go](https://go.dev/). Although **Go** development is out of scope for this workshop, there a few things you need to know:
  1. How to run the application
  2. How to build and run the build service
  3. What endpoints are available to be called and tested
